Gazelle: a system for building fast, reusable parsers

<http://www.reverberate.org/gazelle/>

PRELIMINARY WARNING
===================

While Gazelle is getting quite usable, the language and the APIs are still quite
subject to change.

Still with me?  Great. :)

BUILDING
========

You need to have Lua installed to do anything interesting.  The C runtime
doesn't need Lua, but without Lua you can't compile any grammars.

Gazelle should build mostly out-of-the-box on UNIX-like systems if Lua 5.1 is
installed, but you may need to tweak the Makefile to point to your local Lua
installation.  Ubuntu Linux, Debian and Mac OS X are tested.  To install
dependencies on Ubuntu or Debian, type:

$ sudo aptitude install lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev

To build and install Gazelle, type:

$ make
$ make install

if os is freebsd-like,type:
$ make
$ make macinstall

You can change the installation location as follows:

$ make PREFIX=/usr/local
$ make install PREFIX=/usr/local DESTDIR=/tmp

This will install Gazelle into /tmp/usr/local.

To build the documentation, you need to have asciidoc installed, as well
as graphviz if you want to see the graphics. 

$ make doc

Alternatively you can just read the manual on the Gazelle website.

ROADMAP OF THE SOURCE
=====================

compiler/
  what parses the grammar, turns it into state machines, and dumps into bytcode
compiler/bootstrap
  compiler code that will not be needed once Gazelle is self-hosting
lang_ext/
  wrappers around the C runtime, for high-level languages (currently only Lua)
runtime/
  the tiny, fast, small-memory-footprint C runtime that actually does the parsing
runtime/include
  public header files for the runtime.
sketches/
  code that is either half-written or for debugging-only
tests/
  unit tests (not very many at the moment)
utilities/
  command-line utilities for doing useful things
